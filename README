muttrc is linked to $HOME/.muttrc

By default when I run mutt it loads muttrc which loads some common settings,
then local system settings (eg. OS specific), then loads default which setups
the default account.  That sets stuff like the mailboxes and spooldir for the
provider.

private/* contains files that are sourced for mail passwords etc.
